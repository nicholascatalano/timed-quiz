# Timed Fruit Quiz

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a timed fruit quiz, that encourages the user to answer all questions within the 75 second time limit. The application also allows the user to save their score locally.

#### Install
No install necessary; please visit: https://nicholascatalano.github.io/timed-quiz/

#### Use
After visiting the above webpage, you can begin the quiz by clicking the start button. Once the start button is clicked, a timer will appear and begin counting down from 75 seconds. After answering a question, it will automatically move you to the next question while also alerting you whether you are correct or incorrect. If you answer a question incorrectly, your time will be reduced by 10 seconds.

Whether you answer all 5 questions in time, or if the timer runs out before you answer all questions, you will be sent to the Game Over screen. There you will receive your final tally, as well as how many questions you answer correctly. There you can also enter your name, which will save it to the high scores page. On the high scores page you can either clear the current list of high scores, or click the home button to return back to the main screen to start the quiz again.
